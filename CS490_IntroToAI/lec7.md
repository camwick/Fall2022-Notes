### Logistic Regression : Maximum Likelihood
- LR predicts output variable as 0 or 1, we need to find the best fit
- Maximum likelihood is a cost function which maximizes the likelihood of getting desired output
- Cost function: 

## Bias and Variance
### Bias
- linear regression fits a straight line...
- low bias - can almost accurately model the true relationship and low variability producing consistent predictions through out data set
