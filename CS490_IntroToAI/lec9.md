# Machine Learning
[Back](../README.md)

### Supervised Algorithm
- uses a training set to supervise/learn models to yield the desired output
- training dataset includes inputs and corresponding correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time

### Classification
- assign test data into specific categories
- recognizes specific features within the dataset and conclusion is drawn on based of that
- types
	- binary 
	- multiclass
	- multi-label

### Classification Algorithms
- linear classifiers
- support vector machines (SVM)
- decision trees
- k-nearest neighbor
- random forest
- naive bayes

### Python stuff
splitting training set : 80/20
```python
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
numpy.randomseed(2)

x = numpy.random.normal(3,1,100)

```
